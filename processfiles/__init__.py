"""
Use this tool to select files of given file types in a folder, and track whether these files have been processed,
regardless of whether the script needs to be run multiple times. Stores progress on the files as a text file in the
same folder, so that a long-running operation on many files can be resumed where it left off if it was stopped.
It will also automatically estimate time to completion.
